/**
 * \class CObject
 * \brief Base class for all 3D in-game objects
 *
 * CObject serves as a base class for all in-game objects, including:
 *  - buildings,
 *  - robots,
 *  - astronaut,
 *  - plants,
 *  - aliens.
 *
 * As every object has its specific behavior, there are or will be
 * separate subclasses for each of the specific objects. For the time being,
 * old object interface is still present, but its functions will be moved to
 * appropriate subclasses with time. The new CObject interface implemented
 * here will feature only functions common to all objects.
