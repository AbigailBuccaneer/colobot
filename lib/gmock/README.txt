This directory contains part of distribution of Google Test (http://code.google.com/p/googletest/)
 - a C++ framework for unit tests. There are source files, include headers and a custom CMakeLists.txt
to compile static library. Only these files are kept from the official distribution as only
they are necessary. For more info, see the original README file from gtest: REDME-gtest.txt.
License info is kept in the original COPYING.txt.
